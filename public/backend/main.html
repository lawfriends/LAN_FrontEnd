            <h2>Specification</h2>
            <h3 id="web-architecture">Web Architecture</h3>
            <p>The Insieme web application is a presentation website for the Insieme Association, which is helping foreigners study
                the Italian Language and integrate easier into the Italian society.</p>
            <p><img src="/backend/assets/img/WebArchitecture-02.svg" alt="Web Architecture of Insieme"
                    title="Web Architecture Diagram"><br>
                In order to separate the business logic from the rendering and styling of the elements, the functionality is
                separated in 2 sections:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Presentation Layer</strong></li>
                <li><strong>The Application Layer</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Because most of the data presented on the website is prone to changes or addition of new information, the Application
                Layer is communicating with the third component of the system:<br>
            <ol start="3">
            <li><strong>The Data Layer</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>This split allows changes to be independently tackled in the required component without the need of chaging the
                interface, just the implementation. In this way, components that communicate with the updated component do not need
                to be aware of any internal change.<br>
                This separation follows the <strong>3 Tier Architecture</strong>, one of the most popular used in web development.
            </p>
            <p>The application is respecting SOLID object oriented programming principles, so each component has a clear role, and
                it is easy to develop components individually. They interract with eachother through method calls and ocasionally
                promisses.</p>
            <h4 id="presentation-layer">1. Presentation Layer</h4>
            <div class="content-second-level">
                <p>The Presentation Layer refers to the interface of the website that the users see and interract with. It consists of
                    different components that communicate and interract with eachother. This part of the application is also reffered to
                    as <strong>front-end</strong>.</p>
                <h5 id="web-browser">Web Browser</h5>
                <p>Data is rendered and displayed for the user in a <strong>web browser</strong>. The web browser is receiving from the
                    user different instructions, such as loading the website at the address “<a
                        href="https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/">https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/</a>”. The browser will make a GET
                    HTTP(S) call to the server that hosts the website at the specified address, and receives a set of static data,
                    usually HTML, CSS and Javascript. The browser interprets them and displays the result. Usually, the main file served
                    when first accessing a website is <strong>index.html</strong></p>
                <h5 id="index.html">INDEX.HTML</h5>
                <p>It is the main file that is rendered by the browser when the user accesses the website on the root address <a
                        href="https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/">https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/</a>. It contains the homepage and
                    it acts like a gateway towards the other pages of the website, having call to action buttons towards other pages of
                    the website.</p>
                <h5 id="pages">Pages</h5>
                <p>The pages are HTML files that contain the template over which the web pages are build. They are including CSS files
                    and JavaScript files from the assets folder, which help render the final page. Each page has a HTML template defined
                    in the Pages folder, such as allcourses.html, event.html.</p>
                <h5 id="assets">Assets</h5>
                <p>The assets are static documents that are included in HTML template in order to manage the style and the functionality
                    of the page, like loading data and adding it in the DOM, or styling HTML elements. DOM (Document Object Model) is an
                    object build by the browser when the web page is loaded.<br>
                    The JavaScript files are taking care of building the functionality of the website and they make requests to the
                    website’s REST API in order to get data from the database, and render it in the DOM.</p>
                </div>
            <h4 id="application-layer">2. Application Layer</h4>
            <div class="content-second-level">
                <p>The Application Layer refers to the business logic part of the website, where dynamic (changing) data is handled. It
                    has different components and sub-layers that help with separation of concerns and independent development of
                    componets. Users do not interract with this section directly, so this it is considered as being part of the
                    <strong>back-end</strong> of the web application.<br>
                    The role of this part of the website is to handle dynamic data, meaning data that is not stored in the code of the
                    application, but in a database. The Application Layer provides the needed data to the front-end, which renders it
                    with the help of the assets. In this way, all the functionality related to rendering and displaying data is managed
                    by the front-end, whereas all the data handling is managed by the application layer.</p>
                <h5 id="index.js">INDEX.JS</h5>
                <p>This is the main file that is used to start and run the server that hosts the web application. In it there are
                    settings for making Swagger REST API work, as well as configurations for the server (such as port, or static files
                    path).</p>
                <h5 id="rest-api-swagger">REST API: SWAGGER</h5>
                <p>The first component of the application layer is the REST Interface. A REST interface is a collections of
                    <strong>resources</strong> that can be accessed (called) over HTTP protocol, so that different types of clients can
                    communicate with the application layer. For example, we defined a rule on GET over the URL “<a
                        href="https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/v1/courses">https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/v1/courses</a>”, so that
                    the JavaScript files attached to the page <strong>allcourses.html</strong> can make a GET request to this URL, and
                    expect a list of courses.<br>
                    We used the Swagger library for defining those resources, but also for building a documentation (that can be
                    accessed at: <a
                        href="https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/backend/swaggerui">https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/backend/swaggerui</a>).
                    There one can find the collection of all supported REST API resources, with the possibility to test them.</p>
                <h5 id="controller-layer">CONTROLLER LAYER</h5>
                <p>The Controller Layer contains the components that are catching the requests that come from the front-end and
                    distributes the appropriate commands to the service components. When the answer from the services comes back, the
                    controller component is responding over HTTP to the front-end.<br>
                    The application has a controller for every type of independent entity that we have in the database:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Course</li>
                    <li>Event</li>
                    <li>Person</li>
                    <li>Comment</li>
                </ol>
                <h5 id="service-layer">SERVICE LAYER</h5>
                <p>The Service Layer contains the components that receive tasks (calls) from the controllers and they are the ones which
                    implement all the logic needed for the dynamic features of the application. They manage and manipulate data that
                    comes from the database before sending it back to the controller, as well as manipulating data that comes from the
                    controller before saving it in the database.<br>
                    The services communicate directly with the corresponding controller components, from where they receive calls, and
                    with the DAO (Data Access Object) componens that are the ones which have access to the database. They call the DAO
                    components when they need to save or get data.<br>
                    The application has a service for every type of independent entity that we have in the database:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>CourseService</li>
                    <li>EventService</li>
                    <li>PersonService</li>
                    <li>CommentService</li>
                </ol>
                <h5 id="data-access-layer">DATA ACCESS LAYER</h5>
                <p>The Data Access Layer consist of components of type DAO (Data Access Object), which have direct access to the
                    database. Only this layer is able to communicate with the database, so if some things change in the database,
                    changes can be done in the corresponding DAO class without changing the rest of the application.<br>
                    The DAO components receive calls from the service components, which request data or send over data to be saved in
                    the database. The DAO components make sure the database has specific tables(otherwise it requests the tables to be
                    built), that incoming data is mapped to the coresponding columns in the database, and that the frontend receives
                    only the needed data.<br>
                    The application has a service for every type of entity that we have in the database:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>CourseDAO</li>
                    <li>EventDAO</li>
                    <li>PersonDAO</li>
                    <li>CommentDAO</li>
                    <li>ResourceDAO - “Resource” is not an independent component, being strictly dependent on Course, but we decided to
                        create a DAO component that handles the basic operations, instead of adding them all to CourseDAO.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <h4 id="data-layer">3. Data Layer</h4>
            <div class="content-second-level">

                <p>The Data Layer refers to the storage of data in a database, assuring the dynamic features of the website.<br>
                    In the database, each independent entity that has data to be stored has its own table:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>course</li>
                    <li>event</li>
                    <li>person</li>
                    <li>comment</li>
                    <li>resource</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Besides the entities, there are 2 tables that are used for mapping 2 many to many relationships:<br>
                    6. course_presentation - which maps the relationship between courses and events<br>
                    7. course_volunteers - which maps the relationship between courses and volunteers (people)</p>
                <p>Those tables are created by the DAO components, and basic SQL operations are performed only by the Data Layer.</p>

            <h3 id="api">API</h3>
            <h4 id="rest-compliance">REST compliance</h4>
            <div class="content-second-level">
                <p>Building this application that uses a REST API to mediate the communication between back-end and front-end, we wanted
                    to respect as much as possible the REST Principles, not only because they are good practices, but also because they
                    are widely known and any developer that may take over the work on Insieme website will be able to easily understand
                    the functionality that the application layer provides.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Cliend-Server</strong> - The app has a strong separation between the functionality executed on the
                        client server, which is mainly rendering data and information, and the functionality executed on the server side
                        which is data handling and manipulation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stateless</strong> - There was no need for stateful or session dependent data to be kept on the server,
                        therefore the app is treating any request as independent and complete</li>
                    <li><strong>Uniform interfaces</strong> - The API documentation is describing the resources what the app is using,
                        as well as their models. Moreover, the requests follow a similar structure, so once you understand how to get
                        data for one of them, you can follow the same pattern for the others. For example: /person/{personID} ,
                        /events/{eventID} , /course/{courseID} are all retrieving the requested resource with the specified ID.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layered system</strong> - The application has components that are split in layers by their role, and
                        they can communicate only with the layers that are addiacent to them. This assures the separation of concerns
                        and a better individual development of components.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Besides these principles, we also needed to decide how to map the requests that need data from 2 or more entities,
                    especially for entities that have a relation in the database.<br>
                    For this, we decided to use the following struncture for the url:<br>
                    <strong>"/main-entity-name/{main-entity-id}/related-entity-name"</strong><br>
                    where <em>main-entity-name</em> and <em>related-entity-name</em> have a relationship in the database (usually one to
                    many or many to many), and this resource will provide all the entries of type “related-entity-name” that are in a
                    relation with the entry of type “main-entity-name” that has the id equal to <em>main-entity-id/</em>. For example,
                    making a GET request on “/person/1/events” will retrieve all events that are in a relation to the person with id =
                    1.</p>

                <div class="answer"> In order to respect OpenAPI specifications, we built the application starting from them.
                This approach let us define the resources that the application offers, as well as the models, and we followed the
                recommended basic configuration that they should have. We ensured we have comprehensive examples for the models, and
                when we reached a good starting point, we generated the Node.JS application using Swagger Generate Server tool. In
                this way, we started developing from a point that was in sync with the OpenAPI specifications.<br>
                The changes or additions to the specification were done in the same time with the functionality, so that we
                continously updated the document when things changed.<br>
                Another important tool is the Swagger Validator which makes sure that the request values respect the data types and
                formats defined in the specifications file.<br>

                <div class="answer"> We used the Swagger UI interface to test every endpoint and we solved the ocasional bugs
                The Insieme web app has a clear separation of static assets, such as HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript files that build the user interface (front-end), from the business logic JavaScript files that only
                handle operations with data. The front-end, static files are stored in the folder “public”, which is configured in
                the application server to serve its files as static. All the other files constitute the server functionality and
                they are only handling data operations through the Swagger routing and the controllers, which decide the mapping of
                the requests to actions.

                <div class="answer"> We used a relational Database because of the relatively big number of relations that were
                needed. Every entity is part of at least 1 relationship, with 2 relationships being many-to-many. In a NoSQL
                database, those would have been complex to map and mantain.<br>
                By using a relational database, we eliminated the need of keeping duplicate data.

            <h4 id="formbuilder-api">123FormBuilder API</h4>

            <p>Link: <a href="https://developer.123formbuilder.com/api-v2/">https://developer.123formbuilder.com/api-v2/</a><br>
                123FormBuilder is a platform that allows users to create forms and manage their submissions. They have an API
                documentation that developers use to integrate forms within other applications.<br>
                We have taken inspiration from 123FB API for implementing queries that were dependent on a relationship.<br>
                For example: <div class="request get"><div class="method">GET</div><div class="url">/forms/{form_id}/submissions</div></div> 
                retrieves all the submission that have been registered on a form with
                id = form_id.<br>
                We used the same approach for getting or saving a new resource for a specific course:<br>
                <div class="request get"><div class="method">GET</div><div class="url">/courses/{courseID}/resources</div></div> 
                <div class="request post"><div class="method">POST</div><div class="url">/courses/{courseID}/resources</div></div> 
            </p>
            
            <h4 id="eventbrite-api">Eventbrite API</h4>
            <p>Link: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api">https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api</a><br>
                Eventbrite is a platform for creating and promoting events. We read their API documentation and checked out how they
                implemented the listing of events. In order to get the events, you have to choose between listing them:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>by venue: 
                    <div class="request get"><div class="method">GET</div><div class="url">/venues/{venueID}/events/</div></div> 
                </li>
                <li>by organizer:
                    <div class="request get"><div class="method">GET</div><div class="url">/organizations/{organizationID}/events/</div></div> 
                </li>
                <li>by series:
                    <div class="request get"><div class="method">GET</div><div class="url">/series/{seriesID}/events/</div></div> 
                </li>        
            </ul>
            <p>We used the same resource format on the relationship between people and events, allowing us to retrieve all the
                events for which a person is a contact:</p>
            <div class="request get"><div class="method">GET</div><div class="url">/person/{id}/events</div></div> 

            <h4 id="meetup.com-api"><a href="http://Meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> API</h4>
            <p>Link: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/">https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/</a><br>
                Meetup.com is a platform that facilitates community gatherings. You can create a
                community and have recurring events that are happening for its members.<br>
                When you create a new event, you can set this parameter:<br>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>event_hosts</strong> - String containing up to 5 comma-separated valid member ids for members who will be hosts of the event. 
                </blockquote>
                
                We used the same tactic where we needed to have a list of primitive values, such as in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>daysOfWeek</strong> in Course model: ‘Monday;Tuesday;Sunday’</li>
                <li><strong>times</strong> in Course model: ‘16:00;17:00;18:00’</li>
                <li><strong>photos</strong> in Event and Person models: ‘url1;url2’</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Aida Denisa Opîrlesc</h4>
            <p>Aida is very passionate about technology and digital product development, and has experience in both web and mobile development. She is more familiar to front-end technology, so she decided to take over the back-end of this web application, in order to learn how to build a Node.JS application.</p>
            <p>It has been challenging to work with unfamiliar technology, such as Node.JS, Knex.JS and Swagger. She learned what are OpenAPI specifications and how to implement a REST API starting from them. She also learned how to manage the database connection and tables starting fron Knex.JS</p>
            <p>Another challenge was debugging in production on the Heroku platform and finding solutions to unexpected back-end and front-end issues.</p>
            <p>She enjoyed working with Nathalie and Lorenzo, and feels that she learned a lot working with them. She will use this knowledge in her professional web developer career, and on side projects that she is working on.</p>


            <h4>Nathalie Giselle Ospina Cruz</h4>
            <p>Nathalie learned there is an impact of design decisions in the backend and in the frontend development. She gained a new understanding of the structure of the web application layers which will be useful in her role as a designer to communicate better with developing teams and translate the user needs into functionalities. </p>
            <p>She also increased her knowledge about usability, responsiveness and accessibility. She is now capable of collaborating in a development project through GitHub, populating a database with Swagger, styling with CSS3 to translate the layout design in the web layout, and using Bootstrap to some extent. </p>
            <p>While learning these aspects from zero, she also increased her knowledge of design; tools such as Adobe XD, study of design principles and user stories for features’ design. She would like to know more about different frameworks that are used in the market, such as Angular, React or Vue. </p>
            <p>The new knowledge acquired is meaningful for her as a product-service designer considering the high demand of UX/UI designers. She is currently engaged in an internship with a digital team where end-to-end knowledge as well as the capability of collaboration between designers and engineers is very valuable.</p>


            <h4>Lorenzo Amici</h4>

            <p>Lorenzo, coming from the Geoinformatics Engineering master and from an environmental background, had just a little previous experience with HTML and CSS; now he has really strengthened his abilities in these languages and truly understood what it means to code and build a real web application, and the structure that supports it. He now also has much more confidence with coding in JavaScript and using CSS to style the pages, since our group wanted to follow the previous design choices very precisely. </p>
            <p>Moreover he discovered tools such as Bootstrap that helped him a lot in the work, and gained much more experience with GitHub and the management of a group project in general. A key feature he got is a deeper consciousness on how all the elements of a website interact and communicate with each other.</p>
            <p>He is now very passionate about applying problem solving to front-end development and wants to keep learning to do it better. </p>
