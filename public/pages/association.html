                 <p class="normal">
                     The Italian language school "Insieme" was founded in 2012 and today it takes shape thanks to the help of about 20 volunteers, from different social and cultural backgrounds, who alternate and coordinate in the preparation of lessons and various school and extracurricular activities, following these simple guidelines: Empathy, Patience, Flexibility and HEART. The InSieme school is one of the voluntary activities of the San Fedele Association (<a href="http://www.sanfedele.net" target="_blank">www.sanfedele.net</a>) and is located in the headquarters of this Church of Milan.

                In 2012 the school was opened on the initiative of a small group of volunteers coordinated by the Jesuit Father Giuseppe Trotta; since then the school has grown and more than 1200 students have passed between the classes and almost 50 teachers have alternated, but the spirit of welcome and integration offered to foreign students remains essential.

              <p class="normal">
                The teaching methodology includes the cognitive approach. More than the teaching of grammar, there is a tendency to favour communication and integration.

              <p class="normal">
                Most students come from Central and South America, but also from Asia (Pakistan, India...).
