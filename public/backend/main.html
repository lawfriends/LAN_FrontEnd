        <h3 id="web-architecture">Web Architecture</h3>
        <p>The Insieme web application is a presentation website for the Insieme Association, which is helping foreigners study
            the Italian Language and integrate easier into the Italian society.</p>
        <p><img src="/backend/assets/img/WebArchitecture-02.svg" alt="Web Architecture of Insieme"
                title="Web Architecture Diagram"><br>
            In order to separate the business logic from the rendering and styling of the elements, the functionality is
            separated in 2 sections:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Presentation Layer</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The Application Layer</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Because most of the data presented on the website is prone to changes or addition of new information, the Application
            Layer is communicating with the third component of the system:<br>
        <ol start="3">
        <li><strong>The Data Layer</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>This split allows changes to be independently tackled in the required component without the need of chaging the
            interface, just the implementation. In this way, components that communicate with the updated component do not need
            to be aware of any internal change.<br>
            This separation follows the <strong>3 Tier Architecture</strong>, one of the most popular used in web development.
        </p>
        <p>The application is respecting SOLID object oriented programming principles, so each component has a clear role, and
            it is easy to develop components individually. They interract with eachother through method calls and ocasionally
            promisses.</p>
        <h4 id="presentation-layer">Presentation Layer</h4>
        <p>The Presentation Layer refers to the interface of the website that the users see and interract with. It consists of
            different components that communicate and interract with eachother. This part of the application is also reffered to
            as <strong>front-end</strong>.</p>
        <h5 id="web-browser">Web Browser</h5>
        <p>Data is rendered and displayed for the user in a <strong>web browser</strong>. The web browser is receiving from the
            user different instructions, such as loading the website at the address “<a
                href="https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/">https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/</a>”. The browser will make a GET
            HTTP(S) call to the server that hosts the website at the specified address, and receives a set of static data,
            usually HTML, CSS and Javascript. The browser interprets them and displays the result. Usually, the main file served
            when first accessing a website is <strong>index.html</strong></p>
        <h5 id="index.html">INDEX.HTML</h5>
        <p>It is the main file that is rendered by the browser when the user accesses the website on the root address <a
                href="https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/">https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/</a>. It contains the homepage and
            it acts like a gateway towards the other pages of the website, having call to action buttons towards other pages of
            the website.</p>
        <h5 id="pages">Pages</h5>
        <p>The pages are HTML files that contain the template over which the web pages are build. They are including CSS files
            and JavaScript files from the assets folder, which help render the final page. Each page has a HTML template defined
            in the Pages folder, such as allcourses.html, event.html.</p>
        <h5 id="assets">Assets</h5>
        <p>The assets are static documents that are included in HTML template in order to manage the style and the functionality
            of the page, like loading data and adding it in the DOM, or styling HTML elements. DOM (Document Object Model) is an
            object build by the browser when the web page is loaded.<br>
            The JavaScript files are taking care of building the functionality of the website and they make requests to the
            website’s REST API in order to get data from the database, and render it in the DOM.</p>
        <h4 id="application-layer">Application Layer</h4>
        <p>The Application Layer refers to the business logic part of the website, where dynamic (changing) data is handled. It
            has different components and sub-layers that help with separation of concerns and independent development of
            componets. Users do not interract with this section directly, so this it is considered as being part of the
            <strong>back-end</strong> of the web application.<br>
            The role of this part of the website is to handle dynamic data, meaning data that is not stored in the code of the
            application, but in a database. The Application Layer provides the needed data to the front-end, which renders it
            with the help of the assets. In this way, all the functionality related to rendering and displaying data is managed
            by the front-end, whereas all the data handling is managed by the application layer.</p>
        <h5 id="index.js">INDEX.JS</h5>
        <p>This is the main file that is used to start and run the server that hosts the web application. In it there are
            settings for making Swagger REST API work, as well as configurations for the server (such as port, or static files
            path).</p>
        <h5 id="rest-api-swagger">REST API: SWAGGER</h5>
        <p>The first component of the application layer is the REST Interface. A REST interface is a collections of
            <strong>resources</strong> that can be accessed (called) over HTTP protocol, so that different types of clients can
            communicate with the application layer. For example, we defined a rule on GET over the URL “<a
                href="https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/v1/courses">https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/v1/courses</a>”, so that
            the JavaScript files attached to the page <strong>allcourses.html</strong> can make a GET request to this URL, and
            expect a list of courses.<br>
            We used the Swagger library for defining those resources, but also for building a documentation (that can be
            accessed at: <a
                href="https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/backend/swaggerui">https://insieme-hya.herokuapp.com/backend/swaggerui</a>).
            There one can find the collection of all supported REST API resources, with the possibility to test them.</p>
        <h5 id="controller-layer">CONTROLLER LAYER</h5>
        <p>The Controller Layer contains the components that are catching the requests that come from the front-end and
            distributes the appropriate commands to the service components. When the answer from the services comes back, the
            controller component is responding over HTTP to the front-end.<br>
            The application has a controller for every type of independent entity that we have in the database:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Course</li>
            <li>Event</li>
            <li>Person</li>
            <li>Comment</li>
        </ol>
        <h5 id="service-layer">SERVICE LAYER</h5>
        <p>The Service Layer contains the components that receive tasks (calls) from the controllers and they are the ones which
            implement all the logic needed for the dynamic features of the application. They manage and manipulate data that
            comes from the database before sending it back to the controller, as well as manipulating data that comes from the
            controller before saving it in the database.<br>
            The services communicate directly with the corresponding controller components, from where they receive calls, and
            with the DAO (Data Access Object) componens that are the ones which have access to the database. They call the DAO
            components when they need to save or get data.<br>
            The application has a service for every type of independent entity that we have in the database:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>CourseService</li>
            <li>EventService</li>
            <li>PersonService</li>
            <li>CommentService</li>
        </ol>
        <h5 id="data-access-layer">DATA ACCESS LAYER</h5>
        <p>The Data Access Layer consist of components of type DAO (Data Access Object), which have direct access to the
            database. Only this layer is able to communicate with the database, so if some things change in the database,
            changes can be done in the corresponding DAO class without changing the rest of the application.<br>
            The DAO components receive calls from the service components, which request data or send over data to be saved in
            the database. The DAO components make sure the database has specific tables(otherwise it requests the tables to be
            built), that incoming data is mapped to the coresponding columns in the database, and that the frontend receives
            only the needed data.<br>
            The application has a service for every type of entity that we have in the database:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>CourseDAO</li>
            <li>EventDAO</li>
            <li>PersonDAO</li>
            <li>CommentDAO</li>
            <li>ResourceDAO - “Resource” is not an independent component, being strictly dependent on Course, but we decided to
                create a DAO component that handles the basic operations, instead of adding them all to CourseDAO.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="data-layer">Data Layer</h4>
        <p>The Data Layer refers to the storage of data in a database, assuring the dynamic features of the website.<br>
            In the database, each independent entity that has data to be stored has its own table:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>course</li>
            <li>event</li>
            <li>person</li>
            <li>comment</li>
            <li>resource</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Besides the entities, there are 2 tables that are used for mapping 2 many to many relationships:<br>
            6. course_presentation - which maps the relationship between courses and events<br>
            7. course_volunteers - which maps the relationship between courses and volunteers (people)</p>
        <p>Those tables are created by the DAO components, and basic SQL operations are performed only by the Data Layer.</p>
        <h3 id="api">API</h3>
        <h4 id="rest-compliance">REST compliance</h4>
        <p>Building this application that uses a REST API to mediate the communication between back-end and front-end, we wanted
            to respect as much as possible the REST Principles, not only because they are good practices, but also because they
            are widely known and any developer that may take over the work on Insieme website will be able to easily understand
            the functionality that the application layer provides.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cliend-Server</strong> - The app has a strong separation between the functionality executed on the
                client server, which is mainly rendering data and information, and the functionality executed on the server side
                which is data handling and manipulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Stateless</strong> - There was no need for stateful or session dependent data to be kept on the server,
                therefore the app is treating any request as independent and complete</li>
            <li><strong>Uniform interfaces</strong> - The API documentation is describing the resources what the app is using,
                as well as their models. Moreover, the requests follow a similar structure, so once you understand how to get
                data for one of them, you can follow the same pattern for the others. For example: /person/{personID} ,
                /events/{eventID} , /course/{courseID} are all retrieving the requested resource with the specified ID.</li>
            <li><strong>Layered system</strong> - The application has components that are split in layers by their role, and
                they can communicate only with the layers that are addiacent to them. This assures the separation of concerns
                and a better individual development of components.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Besides these principles, we also needed to decide how to map the requests that need data from 2 or more entities,
            especially for entities that have a relation in the database.<br>
            For this, we decided to use the following struncture for the url:<br>
            <strong>"/main-entity-name/{main-entity-id}/related-entity-name"</strong><br>
            where <em>main-entity-name</em> and <em>related-entity-name</em> have a relationship in the database (usually one to
            many or many to many), and this resource will provide all the entries of type “related-entity-name” that are in a
            relation with the entry of type “main-entity-name” that has the id equal to <em>main-entity-id/</em>. For example,
            making a GET request on “/person/1/events” will retrieve all events that are in a relation to the person with id =
            1.</p>
        <h4 id="openapi-resource-models">OpenAPI Resource models</h4>
        <p>In order to ensure a good communication between back-end and front-end, we introduced models for the resources, that
            they have to respect.</p>
        <h5 id="course">Course</h5>

            association’s courses and events. They can be reviews of the association, or comments about a specific volunteer
            (teacher). It has the following properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>id</strong>: integer - the unique identifier of a comment</li>
            <li><strong>text</strong>: string - the text containing the opinion (comment)</li>
            <li><strong>student_name</strong>: string - the name of the student which made the comment</li>
            <li><strong>photo</strong>: string - url to the photo of the student</li>
            <li><strong>date</strong>: string (format: date-time) - date in which the comment was made</li>
            <li><strong>person_id</strong>: integer - the unique identifier of the person about who this comment is; if it is
                null, then the comment is not about a person, but about the association on the whole.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="tools-used">Tools used</h3>
        <h4 id="javascript">JavaScript</h4>
        <p>JavaScript is the main programming language used for web development, that is able to bring functionality upon
            otherwise static HTML files. The language is known and interpreted by all browsers, and a lot of frameworks and
            libraries based on it are created each year.</p>
        <h4 id="node.js">Node.JS</h4>
        <p>Node.JS is a runtime environment which can run JavaScript outside of a browser. It is widely used for back-end
            development in the web industry and it facilitates the creation of servers that are able to handle HTTP requests and
            communicate to other services or databases.</p>
        <h4 id="swagger-with-openapi-specifications">Swagger with OpenAPI Specifications</h4>
        <p>Swagger is a framework that is used for easily creating documentation and managing REST APIs. It is based on OpenAPI
            Specifications, that are rules for configuring REST APIs in a JSON or YAML document. Swagger frameworn offers data
            validation, routing the request to appropriate controls, an interface for the documentation in which requests can be
            tested out, and many more.</p>
        <h4 id="knex.js">KNEX.JS</h4>
        <p>Knex.js is a query-builder library for JavaScript in which you use different methods in order to connect and perform
            operations over databases. The Insieme web app uses this library for creating tables, saving and retrieving data
            from the database.</p>
        <h4 id="postgresql">PostgreSQL</h4>
        <p>PostgreSQL is the most advanced open source relational database, which is better suited for complex application that
            MySQL, another popular choice for web applications.</p>
        <h4 id="heroku">Heroku</h4>
        <p>Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS), that allows developers to easily deploy and test their application in the
            cloud, without prior knowledge of server management and configuration. It comes with a CLI (Command-Line Interface)
            that makes it very easy to deploy the latest version of a website online. If the website needs a database, Heroku
            offers the possibility to add a PostgreSLQ database as an addon, that you can connect to the web app.</p>
        <h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
        <p><strong>Question</strong>: How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided<br>
            OpenAPI specification?<br>
            <strong>Answer</strong>: In order to respect OpenAPI specifications, we built the application starting from them.
            This approach let us define the resources that the application offers, as well as the models, and we followed the
            recommended basic configuration that they should have. We ensured we have comprehensive examples for the models, and
            when we reached a good starting point, we generated the Node.JS application using Swagger Generate Server tool. In
            this way, we started developing from a point that was in sync with the OpenAPI specifications.<br>
            The changes or additions to the specification were done in the same time with the functionality, so that we
            continously updated the document when things changed.<br>
            Another important tool is the Swagger Validator which makes sure that the request values respect the data types and
            formats defined in the specifications file.<br>
            <strong>Question</strong>: Which method did you use to test all APIs endpoints against the expected response?<br>
            <strong>Answer</strong>: We used the Swagger UI interface to test every endpoint and we solved the ocasional bugs
            when we noticed them. Alternatively, we used also Postman for making API request with testing purposes.<br>
            <strong>Question</strong>: Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to partition a
            REST-based web application (static assets vs. application data)<br>
            <strong>Answer</strong>: The Insieme web app has a clear separation of static assets, such as HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript files that build the user interface (front-end), from the business logic JavaScript files that only
            handle operations with data. The front-end, static files are stored in the folder “public”, which is configured in
            the application server to serve its files as static. All the other files constitute the server functionality and
            they are only handling data operations through the Swagger routing and the controllers, which decide the mapping of
            the requests to actions.<br>
            <strong>Question</strong>: Which technology did you use (relational or a no-SQL database) for<br>
            managing the data model?<br>
            <strong>Answer</strong>: We used a relational Database because of the relatively big number of relations that were
            needed. Every entity is part of at least 1 relationship, with 2 relationships being many-to-many. In a NoSQL
            database, those would have been complex to map and mantain.<br>
            By using a relational database, we eliminated the need of keeping duplicate data.</p>

        <h3 id="formbuilder-api">123FormBuilder API</h3>
        <p>Link: <a href="https://developer.123formbuilder.com/api-v2/">https://developer.123formbuilder.com/api-v2/</a><br>
            123FormBuilder is a platform that allows users to create forms and manage their submissions. They have an API
            documentation that developers use to integrate forms within other applications.<br>
            We have taken inspiration from 123FB API for implementing queries that were dependent on a relationship.<br>
            For example: GET /forms/{form_id}/submissions retrieves all the submission that have been registered on a form with
            id = form_id.<br>
            We used the same approach for getting or saving a new resource for a specific course:<br>
            GET (POST) /courses/{courseID}/resources</p>
        <h3 id="eventbrite-api">Eventbrite API</h3>
        <p>Link: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api">https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api</a><br>
            Eventbrite is a platform for creating and promoting events. We read their API documentation and checked out how they
            implemented the listing of events. In order to get the events, you have to choose between listing them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>by venue: GET /venues/{venueID}/events/</li>
            <li>by organizer: GET /organizations/{organizationID}/events/</li>
            <li>by series: GET /series/{seriesID}/events/<br>
                We used the same resource format on the relationship between people and events, allowing us to retrieve all the
                events for which a person is a contact:<br>
                GET /person/{id}/events</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="meetup.com-api"><a href="http://Meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> API</h3>
        <p>Link: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/">https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/</a><br>
            <a href="http://Meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> is a platform that facilitates community gatherings. You can create a
            community and have recurring events that are happening for its members.<br>
            When you create a new event, you can set this parameter:<br>
            <strong>event_hosts</strong> - String containing up to 5 comma-separated valid member ids for members who will be
            hosts of the event.<br>
            We used the same tactic where we needed to have a list of primitive values, such as in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>daysOfWeek</strong> in Course model: ‘Monday;Tuesday;Sunday’</li>
            <li><strong>times</strong> in Course model: ‘16:00;17:00;18:00’</li>
            <li><strong>photos</strong> in Event and Person models: ‘url1;url2’</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="learning-outcome">Learning outcome</h3>
        <p>What was the most important thing all the members have learned while</p>
        <p>developing this part of the project, what questions remained unanswered,<br>
            how you will use what you’ve learned in your everyday life?<br>
            Examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Foo learned to write SQL queries and Javascript but wanted to know<br>
                more about caching, he’s probably going to create his own startup<br>
                with what she has learned</li>
            <li>Bar learned how to deploy on a cloud platform, he would have liked<br>
                to know more about promises for asynchronous code…</li>
